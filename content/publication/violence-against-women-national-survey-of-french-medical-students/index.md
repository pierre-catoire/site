  **Background** : Violence, particularly against women, have a major impact on
  health, sometimes under the mask of many psychic and somatic pathologies if
  their link with the violence could not be done in medical consultation.


  **Method** : A national observational study with prospective data collection from July to October 2013 was conducted among more than 32,000 medical students in France, contacted by email by ANEMF (National Association of Medical Students of France). The questionnaire was written in survey and online questionnaires software. Definitions were presented at the beginning, and answers or useful sites and phone numbers were proposed at the end in case of further questions on the subject. 1,472 students responded to the 12 questions.


  **Results** : Questions on the knowledge on violence against women have a large number of incorrect answers, which can be explained by the fact that more than 80% of the student (s) declare that they have not received training, despite being personally confronted to a number of situations of violence during their course (during training) or among their relatives. Or they are also victims in their personal lives, of psychological violence (1/3), of physical (1/4) or sexual ones (1/10). More than 60% consider that taking care of the victims is rather inadequate or unsuited, while over 90% felt that the role of the physician is important and major and 95% would be interested or very interested by being trained on violence, to better detect and deal with the consequences. 


  **Conclusion** : This survey, rich in teachings, confirms to us the need for education on violence throughout the course of medical studies, in order to improve the identification, medical care and support for the victims.
