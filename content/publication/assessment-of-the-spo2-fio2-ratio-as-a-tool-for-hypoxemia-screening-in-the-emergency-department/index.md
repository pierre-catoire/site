summary: >-
  - SpO2/FiO2 ratio could be a reliable tool for estimation of PaO2/FiO2 ratio
  among patients admitted for respiratory symptoms.

  - Diagnostic performance seems to be unaffected by the presence or absence of COVID-19 infection.

  - SpO2/FiO2 threshold of 370 showed satisfactory diagnostic performance for the positive diagnosis of PaO2/FiO2 < 300 mmHg.

  - SpO2/FiO2 threshold of 450 showed satisfactory diagnostic performance for exclusion of PaO2/FiO2 < 400 mmHg.
