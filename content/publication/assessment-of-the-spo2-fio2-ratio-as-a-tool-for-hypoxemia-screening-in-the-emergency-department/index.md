  **Objective** : We assessed the performance of the ratio of peripheral
  arterial oxygen saturation to the inspired fraction of oxygen (SpO2/FiO2) to
  predict the ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen to the fraction of
  inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) among patients admitted to our emergency
  department (ED) during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.


  **Methods** : We retrospectively studied patients admitted to an academic-level ED in France who were undergoing a joint measurement of SpO2 and arterial blood gas. We compared SpO2 with SaO2 and evaluated performance of the SpO2/FiO2 ratio for the prediction of 300 and 400 mmHg PaO2/FiO2 cut-off values in COVID-19 positive and negative subgroups using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves.


  **Results** : During the study period from February to April 2020, a total of 430 arterial samples were analyzed and collected from 395 patients. The area under the ROC curves of the SpO2/FiO2 ratio was 0.918 (CI 95% 0.885–0.950) and 0.901 (CI 95% 0.872–0.930) for PaO2/FiO2 thresholds of 300 and 400 mmHg, respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) of an SpO2/FiO2 threshold of 350 for PaO2/FiO2 inferior to 300 mmHg was 0.88 (CI95% 0.84–0.91), whereas the negative predictive value (NPV) of the SpO2/FiO2 threshold of 470 for PaO2/FiO2 inferior to 400 mmHg was 0.89 (CI95% 0.75–0.96). No significant differences were found between the subgroups.


  **Conclusions** : The SpO2/FiO2 ratio may be a reliable tool for hypoxemia screening among patients admitted to the ED, particularly during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.

summary: We evaluated the SpO2/FiO2 ratio as a tool for estimation of PaO2/FiO2
  ratio among patients admitted for respiratory symptoms. SpO2/FiO2 threshold of
  370 showed satisfactory diagnostic performance for the positive diagnosis of
  PaO2/FiO2 < 300 mmHg. SpO2/FiO2 threshold of 450 showed satisfactory
  diagnostic performance for exclusion of PaO2/FiO2 < 400 mmHg. Diagnostic
  performance seems to be unaffected by the presence or absence of COVID-19
  infection.
