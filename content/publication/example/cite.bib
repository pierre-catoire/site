            Background
            Tracheal intubation in an out-of-hospital setting is a frequent and potentially difficult procedure. The risk of adverse events increases dramatically with the number of attempts. The failure rate of the first intubation attempt ranges from 5 to 32\% and the risk factors are unclear. We evaluated the failure rate of the first intubation attempt in an out-of-hospital setting and identified variables potentially associated with such failure.
            Methods
            This was an observational prospective multicenter study performed over 17 months and involving 10 prehospital emergency medical units. Airway management for patients who needed tracheal intubation followed the national guidelines. Rapid sequence intubation with a sedative and myorelaxant drugs was systematically performed for spontaneously breathing patients. After each tracheal intubation, the operator was required to provide, by completing a data-collection form, information on operator and patient characteristics and the environmental conditions during the intubation. The primary endpoint was failure of the first intubation attempt.
            Results
            During the study period, 1546 patients were analyzed, of whom 59\% had cardiac arrest, and 486 intubations failed on the first attempt (31.4\% [95\% confidence interval = 30.2–32.6]). A multivariate analysis revealed that the following 7 of 28 factors were associated with an increased risk of a failed first intubation attempt: operator with fewer than 50 prior intubations, small inter-incisor space, limited extension of the head, macroglossia, ear/nose/throat tumor, cardiac arrest, and vomiting. The frequency of adverse events was 13.4\% and increased with each additional attempt.
            Conclusions
            The failure rate of the first attempt was high. Most risk factors could be identified only at the moment of occurrence and were not easily anticipated. Finally, the risk of complications increased with the number of attempts.},

	abstract = {Objective
We assessed the performance of the ratio of peripheral arterial oxygen saturation to the inspired fraction of oxygen (SpO2/FiO2) to predict the ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) among patients admitted to our emergency department (ED) during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Methods
We retrospectively studied patients admitted to an academic-level ED in France who were undergoing a joint measurement of SpO2 and arterial blood gas. We compared SpO2 with SaO2 and evaluated performance of the SpO2/FiO2 ratio for the prediction of 300 and 400 mmHg PaO2/FiO2 cut-off values in COVID-19 positive and negative subgroups using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves.
Results
During the study period from February to April 2020, a total of 430 arterial samples were analyzed and collected from 395 patients. The area under the ROC curves of the SpO2/FiO2 ratio was 0.918 (CI 95\% 0.885–0.950) and 0.901 (CI 95\% 0.872–0.930) for PaO2/FiO2 thresholds of 300 and 400 mmHg, respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) of an SpO2/FiO2 threshold of 350 for PaO2/FiO2 inferior to 300 mmHg was 0.88 (CI95\% 0.84–0.91), whereas the negative predictive value (NPV) of the SpO2/FiO2 threshold of 470 for PaO2/FiO2 inferior to 400 mmHg was 0.89 (CI95\% 0.75–0.96). No significant differences were found between the subgroups.
Conclusions
The SpO2/FiO2 ratio may be a reliable tool for hypoxemia screening among patients admitted to the ED, particularly during the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.},

Propos
Le troisième cycle des études médicales (TCEM) constitue la base de la formation spécialisée des médecins en France. L’objectif a été d’évaluer les pratiques d’enseignement théorique au cours du troisième cycle des études médicales en : 1) recueillant des données auprès des internes en médecine dans les différentes facultés de France ; 2) comparant ces données aux pratiques opposables quand cela était possible ; 3) et en proposant des mesures d’amélioration.
Méthodes
Une enquête sur les pratiques d’enseignement théorique en TCEM a été réalisée par auto-questionnaire, libre et anonyme, administré par voie électronique du 3 juillet au 31 octobre 2013 à l’ensemble des étudiants en TCEM de France.
Résultats
Les enseignements nationaux, inter-régionaux, régionaux et sur le terrain de stage n’existent pas dans respectivement 50,5 \%, 42,8 \%, 26,0 \% et 30,2 \% des cas. Les internes ont recours à des formations complémentaires en raison d’une formation de DES et/ou DESC 2 jugée insuffisante (43,7 \%) ou dans le cadre d’un projet professionnel (54,9 \%). Les thématiques transversales à développer étaient le développement de carrière (58,9 \%), la gestion d’un cabinet ou d’un service (50,7 \%), l’anglais médical (50,4 \%) et l’organisation de leur spécialité (49,9 \%). Ils souhaiteraient pour 54,1 \% d’entre eux être évalués annuellement sur le plan théorique.
Conclusion
Il s’agit de la première évaluation nationale du TCEM en France sur le versant de l’enseignement théorique. Complétée par le versant pratique, elle pourrait permettre de proposer une réforme du TCEM capable d’accroître l’efficience de la formation, sans allongement de sa durée.
Objectives
In France, medical students regularly complain about the shortcomings of their theoretical training and the necessity of its adaptation to better fit the needs of students. The goal was to evaluate the theoretical teaching practices in postgraduate medical studies by: 1) collecting data from medical students in different medical faculties in France; 2) comparing this data with expected practices when it is possible; 3) and proposing several lines of improvement.
Methods
A survey of theoretical practices in the 3rd cycle of medical studies was conducted by self-administered questionnaires which were free of charge, anonymous, and administered electronically from July 3 to October 31, 2013 to all medical students in France.
Results
National, inter-regional, regional and field internship educational content was absent in respectively 50.5\%, 42.8\%, 26.0\% and 30.2\% of cases. Medical students follow complementary training due to insufficient DES and/or DESC 2 training in 43.7\% of cases or as part of a professional project in 54.9\% of cases. The knowledge sought by medical students concerns the following crosscutting topics: career development (58.9\%), practice management (50.7\%), medical English (50.4\%) and their specialty organization (49.9\%). Fifty-four point one percent would like to be evaluated on their theoretical training on an annual basis.
Conclusion
The results of this first national survey give insights into the theoretical teaching conditions in postgraduate medical education in France and the aspirations of medical students.},
