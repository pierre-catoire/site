I am currently an Emergency Medicine Fellow (*Chef de Clinique*) at the University Hospital of Bordeaux, and practice in hospital, pre-hospital and dispatch settings.  As part of my fellowship, I also carry out research and teaching activities at the University of Bordeaux.
My main clinical research focuses on the management of respiratory, metabolic and traumatic emergencies, in particular on clinical decision support by improving the integration of clinical information.

To develop these clinical tools, I rely on innovative statistical approaches, as I am learning them in the Biostatistics master's degree of the Institute of Public Health, Epidemiology and Development (ISPED) in Bordeaux. In particular, I am interested in Bayesian and causal inference approaches.

I also teach emergency medicine at the University of Bordeaux to medical students, senior doctors, nurses and paramedical staff. In addition to my clinical subjects, my main teaching topics are clinical reasoning, decision making under uncertainty, and resilience to error. I am recently involved in free medical education projects (stay tuned!) and in the elaboration and sharing of clinical guidelines within the French Society of Emergency Medicine (SFMU).
