title: "Stewart approach in emergency medicine : Why chloremia ?"
abstract: Although it has recently celebrated its fiftieth anniversary, and has
  shown great value in the diagnosis and management of acid-base disorders,
  Stewart's approach remains largely unused in emergency medicine. How can the
  notions of strong ion difference, dyschloremia, the role of bicarbonates and
  lactate be better interpreted?
