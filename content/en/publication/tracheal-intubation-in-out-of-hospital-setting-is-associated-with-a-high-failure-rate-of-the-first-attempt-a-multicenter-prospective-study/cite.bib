	abstract = {Background Tracheal intubation in an out-of-hospital setting is a frequent and potentially difficult procedure. The risk of adverse events increases dramatically with the number of attempts. The failure rate of the first intubation attempt ranges from 5 to 32\% and the risk factors are unclear. We evaluated the failure rate of the first intubation attempt in an out-of-hospital setting and identified variables potentially associated with such failure.
Methods This was an observational prospective multicenter study performed over 17 months and involving 10 prehospital emergency medical units. Airway management for patients who needed tracheal intubation followed the national guidelines. Rapid sequence intubation with a sedative and myorelaxant drugs was systematically performed for spontaneously breathing patients. After each tracheal intubation, the operator was required to provide, by completing a data-collection form, information on operator and patient characteristics and the environmental conditions during the intubation. The primary endpoint was failure of the first intubation attempt.
Results During the study period, 1546 patients were analyzed, of whom 59\% had cardiac arrest, and 486 intubations failed on the first attempt (31.4\% [95\% confidence interval = 30.2–32.6]). A multivariate analysis revealed that the following 7 of 28 factors were associated with an increased risk of a failed first intubation attempt: operator with fewer than 50 prior intubations, small inter-incisor space, limited extension of the head, macroglossia, ear/nose/throat tumor, cardiac arrest, and vomiting. The frequency of adverse events was 13.4\% and increased with each additional attempt.
Conclusions The failure rate of the first attempt was high. Most risk factors could be identified only at the moment of occurrence and were not easily anticipated. Finally, the risk of complications increased with the number of attempts.},
